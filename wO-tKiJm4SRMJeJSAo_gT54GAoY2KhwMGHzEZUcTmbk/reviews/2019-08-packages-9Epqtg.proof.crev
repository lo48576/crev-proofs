comment: "I've found unsoundness and reported it: <https://github.com/Robbepop/string-interner/issues/9>.\nThis is use after free, but user cannot access that dangling pointer directly,\nand invalid write access will not happen.\nThis issue is caused by `StringInterner::clone()` followed by `StringInterner::{get,get_or_intern}`,\nso this would affect many use cases.\nThis is the reason of negative rating.\n\nExcept for that issue, there seems no problem.\n\n* `unsafe` at line 125 is safe thanks to `assert!` at the previous line.\n* `unsafe` at line 165 is safe because\n    + `InternalStrRef`s are immutable,\n    + they have `*const str` referring inside private `Vec<Box<str>>`, and\n    + `InternalStrRef`s are not taken or copied to the outside of `StringInterner` type.\n    + (It is unsafe that `InternalStrRef` refers string owned by another interner instance,\n      and it is reported as stated above.)\n* `unsafe impl`s at line 233 and 239 is safe as commented in the source.\n    + Addresses of strings in `Vec<Box<str>>` is not changed until drop.\n    + `InternalStrRef` and its content pointers are not exposed to the users.\n    + Pointers to the strings are read-only.\n\nOnce the UB bug is fixed, this crate would be safe.\n"

  It is completely written in safe Rust, and I didn't find any malicious code.
  
  I've found a minor issue and a non-obvious behavior which is not documented (yet), but I think they are not severe and they have very easy workarounds.
  You can see <https://github.com/RazrFalcon/rctree/issues> if you want to know them.
  
  In conclusion, I think this crate is safe to use.
