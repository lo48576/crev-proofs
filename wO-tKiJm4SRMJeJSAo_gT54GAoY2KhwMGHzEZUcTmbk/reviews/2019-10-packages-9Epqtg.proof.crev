  **EDIT**: The found unsoundness is reported as vulnerability (RUSTSEC-2019-0023).
  This is already fixed in 0.7.1, so you should use 0.7.1 or above.
  
  * * *
  
  I've found unsoundness and reported it: <https://github.com/Robbepop/string-interner/issues/9>.
  This is use after free, but user cannot access that dangling pointer directly,
  and invalid write access will not happen.
  This issue is caused by `StringInterner::clone()` followed by `StringInterner::{get,get_or_intern}`,
  so this would affect many use cases.
  This is the reason of negative rating.
  
  Except for that issue, there seems no problem.
  
  * `unsafe` at line 125 is safe thanks to `assert!` at the previous line.
  * `unsafe` at line 165 is safe because
      + `InternalStrRef`s are immutable,
      + they have `*const str` referring inside private `Vec<Box<str>>`, and
      + `InternalStrRef`s are not taken or copied to the outside of `StringInterner` type.
      + (It is unsafe that `InternalStrRef` refers string owned by another interner instance,
        and it is reported as stated above.)
  * `unsafe impl`s at line 233 and 239 is safe as commented in the source.
      + Addresses of strings in `Vec<Box<str>>` is not changed until drop.
      + `InternalStrRef` and its content pointers are not exposed to the users.
      + Pointers to the strings are read-only.
  
  Once the UB bug is fixed, this crate would be safe.
